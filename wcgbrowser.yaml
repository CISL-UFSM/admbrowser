# Default: about:blank

# Default: False

fullscreen: False

# Set "navigation" to false to hide the top navigation bar.  Note that this makes bookmarks basically useless, since they won't appear.
# Default: True

#navigation: True

# "icon_theme" probably only works on Linux, but set it to an installed theme to set the icons for back/forward/reload/quit.
# The default is whatever your qt4 is set to use.

icon_theme:  "oxygen"


# "quit_button_text" changes the text on the quit/reset button at the upper right

# Bookmarks are set in this structure.  They will appear as buttons on the top navigation bar.
# Each bookmark entry takes this form (note the indentation):
# "&Button Label":
#    url: "http://www.example.com"
#    description: "A description of the website which will appear in the tooltip"
#
# The ampersand is optional, but if present the character following it will be the keyboard accelerator 
# (e.g., in the example alt-B would activate the bookmark)
# Default: empty

# The format is 
# "content-type": "program to open with"
# The filename of the downloaded data will be passed as an argument
