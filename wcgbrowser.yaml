# This file uses yaml syntax
# Just like python, indentation is critical.  Use a good text editor to hack on this.


# This is the "home page" for your kiosk.  It will start here, and return here if reset

# Set to 0 to disable this feature 
# Default: 0

# 1.0 is "unzoomed", 0.5 is half-size, 2.0 is double size, etc. 
# Default: 1.0

#zoom_factor: 1.5

# "allow_popups" determines whether or not hyperlinks that try to open new browser windows/tabs will be honored or ignored. 
# Default: False

#allow_popups: True

# Set "fullscreen" to true to force the browser window fullscreen
# Default: False

fullscreen: False

# Set "navigation" to false to hide the top navigation bar.  Note that this makes bookmarks basically useless, since they won't appear.
# Default: True

#navigation: True

# "icon_theme" probably only works on Linux, but set it to an installed theme to set the icons for back/forward/reload/quit.
# The default is whatever your qt4 is set to use.

icon_theme:  "oxygen"


# Bookmarks are set in this structure.  They will appear as buttons on the top navigation bar.
# Each bookmark entry takes this form (note the indentation):
# "&Button Label":
#    url: "http://www.example.com"
#    description: "A description of the website which will appear in the tooltip"
#
# The ampersand is optional, but if present the character following it will be the keyboard accelerator 
# (e.g., in the example alt-B would activate the bookmark)
# Default: empty
